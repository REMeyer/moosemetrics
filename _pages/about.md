<p>Hi! I'm R Elliot Meyer and MooseMetrics is my Canada-focused data blog. I am currently astrophysicist at the University of Oxford. In my role as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant, I am conducting research on and developing the Planetary Camera and Spectrograph (PCS) instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Check out my <a href="https://relliotmeyer.ca">personal site</a> for more information about this research and more.</p>

<p>This blog was created to cover mainly Canadian content, with a focus on analyzing public data from all levels of government. There will also be the odd personal project as well. **Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments about any of my posts or if you just want to chat.**</p>
